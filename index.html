    <h3 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">Companies have an intrinsic value, and that intrinsic value is based on the amount of free cash flow they can provide during their effective lifetime. Money earned later is worth less than money earned now, however, so future free cash flows have to be discounted at an appropriate rate. The theory behind most stock valuation methods is that the value of a business is equal to the sum value of all future free cash flows. All future cash flows are discounted due to the time value of money. If you objectively know all future cash flows of a company, and you have a target rate of return on your money, then you can know the exact amount of money you should pay for that company. But stock valuation is not that easy in practice, because we can only estimate future free cash flows. This valuation approach, therefore, is a blend of art and science. Given the inputs, the outputs are factual. If we knew exactly how much cash flow is to be generated, and we have a target rate of return, we can know exactly what to pay for a dividend stock or any company with positive free cash flows regardless of whether it pays a dividend or not. But the inputs themselves are only estimates, and require a degree of skill and experience to be accurate with. Therefore, stock valuation is art and science. Many valuation metrics are readily calculated, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, or price-to-sales, or price-to-book. But these are numbers that only hold value with respect to some other form of stock valuation.</p>

    <h3>Article No. 2</h3>
    <p>The first method is the quickest to use and you will read about it everywhere as it stands with a single number. Sometimes called an Earnings Multiple Approach, it can be used whether or not the company pays a dividend. The investor estimates future earnings over a period of time, such as ten years, and then places a hypothetical earnings multiple on the final estimated EPS value. Then, cumulative dividends are taken into account, and the difference between the current stock price, and the total hypothetical value at the end of the time period, are compared in order to calculate the expected rate of return. I think it’s a great starting point but you can’t use this value alone. I prefer looking at the company’s 10 year P/E ratio evolution. This gives me a better idea of how the market values the business. After all, it doesn’t really matter how I value it if the whole market is against me. You want to make sure you can sell the stock at a higher price at one point.</p>
